========

## Lesson synopsis:

In this session we will start by reviewing case studies of (lack of) reproducibility gone wrong. Then participants will work on two reproducibility exercises: first a simple data manipulation and analysis exercise using any software they generally work with and then the same exercise (and extensions to it) using `RMarkdown` in RStudio as a better alternative, highlighting how this approach makes documentation, organization, automation, and dissemination easier.  

## Syllabus:

* Recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address
* Identify pain points in getting your analysis to be reproducible.
* The role of documentation, sharing, automation, and organization in making your research more reproducible.
* Introducing some tools to solve these problems, specifically R/RStudio/RMarkdown.

## Goals:

At the beginning of this session, participants should be able to

- use a spreadsheet program to generate a plot
- use a text editor (Word, Google Docs, etc.) to communicate

At the end of the session students will be able to

- recognize the problems that reproducible research helps address
- identify pain points in getting their analysis to be reproducible

The specific problems to be addressed in each session are as follows:

- First half (01): motivating reproducibility
- Second half (02): introduce R Markdown as a reproducible data analysis tool

The first half of the intro session is language agnostic. If  a workshop uses programming language other than R, only intro-02 will need to be modified.

## Pre-workshop:

Participants install R+RStudio.

See [email template](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-intro/blob/master/preworkshop-email.md).

## First half (01):

See instructor notes (`intro-01-instr-notes.Rmd`) for details.

- Welcome + go over schedule
- Motivating reproducibility slides
- Group discussion about current tools people are using for documentation / reproducibility
- Ex 1: Motivating reproducibility

## Second half (02):

See instructor notes (`intro-02-instr-notes.Rmd`) for details. 

- Provide RMarkdown approach to what's done in Session 1 (intro-template.Rmd)

- Wrap up with pointing participants to the [reproducibility checklist](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-intro/blob/master/checklist.md).
